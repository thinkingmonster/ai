      "Home - Edward Donner HomeConnect FourOutsmartAn arena that pits LLMs against each other in a battle of diplomacy and deviousnessAboutPosts Well, hi there. I’m Ed. I like writing code and experimenting with LLMs, and hopefully you’re here because you do too. I also enjoy DJing (but I’m badly out of practice), amateur electronic music production (very amateur) and losing myself in Hacker News, nodding my head sagely to things I only half understand. I’m the co-founder and CTO of Nebula.io. We’re applying AI to a field where it can make a massive, positive impact: helping people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being. Recruiters use our product today to source, understand, engage and manage talent. I’m previously the founder and CEO of AI startup untapt, acquired in 2021. We work with groundbreaking, proprietary LLMs verticalized for talent, we’ve patented our matching model, and our award-winning platform has happy customers and tons of press coverage.
